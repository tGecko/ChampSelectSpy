2023-05-10 Archiving this repo, as I do not play the game anymore and can't test if it still works. Feel free to fork, download, test, change, etc.

Allows you to view summoner names in champ select automatically. Detects when the game starts and when you enter champ select. Also can be set to automatically multisearch op.gg/u.gg/Porofessor as soon as you are in champ select.

Finally you know again which lobbys to dodge and which to play!
